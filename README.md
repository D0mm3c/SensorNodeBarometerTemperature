<b>Work in Progress</b>

This project is the first entry in my “SensorNode” project series.

The main goal is to design and implement multiple sensor node variants based on the ESP32, each combining different sensor pairs.
These nodes will transmit their measured data via a CAN bus, allowing external systems such as a Raspberry Pi or other controllers to receive, process, and log the sensor data.

The project focuses on:

- Embedded system design

- Sensor integration

- CAN bus communication

- Data acquisition and logging

Further extensions and sensor configurations will be added over time.
